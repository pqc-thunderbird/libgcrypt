 * Name:        mlkem_shake256_prf
 *
 * Description: Usage of SHAKE256 as a PRF, concatenates secret and public
 *input and then generates outlen bytes of SHAKE256 output
 *
 * Arguments:   - unsigned char *out: pointer to output
 *              - size_t outlen: number of requested output bytes
 *              - const unsigned char *key: pointer to the key (of length GCRY_MLKEM_SYMBYTES)
 *              - unsigned char nonce: single-byte nonce (public PRF input)
